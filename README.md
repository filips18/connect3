# Tree
A basic C++ implementation of a tree using only basic C libraries, starting the program gives you a few options: A - create a tree, B - add an element, C - output the tree using preorder, D - show the number of nodes, E - exit.
# Connect3
Using the tree implementation, this part of the project expands upon it to create a simple game tree, which represents all possible moves and their outcome, and displays which player is in the lead at every move played, for the game "Connect 3".This is not supposed to be a game simulator where every player plays their move, rather, it is a tool for analysis of all possible outcomes given a certain starting state.

Starting the program gives you a few options:
- A - Create a tree (meaning you should insert a starting state for the program, the state is inputed as a 5x5 matrix of integers from 0 to 2)
- B - Generate the game tree
- C - Output the tree using preorder
- D - Count the nodes
- E - Exit
